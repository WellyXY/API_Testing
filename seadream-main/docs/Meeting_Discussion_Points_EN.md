# Meeting Discussion Points

## Question 1: What are the main development focuses of your team? (Please limit to projects that occupy 80% or more of the team's time)

**Answer:**
- Our goal is to create a tool based on AI capabilities that helps people better express themselves
- The majority of our time is invested in AI video/image model training and Model APP development
- We hope to create the most Social video/image generation models, allowing ordinary people to realize their imagination through typing

## Question 2: What are the objectives of these development works?

**Answer:**
- Model and APP development goals may differ, but the ultimate desired outcome is consistent. If we want to enable people to create social content at low cost while enjoying the creative process, we need to consider how to combine models and products to provide users with the right experience

## Question 3: What technical challenges have you encountered during the development process? (Related to project design, methods, or capabilities)

**Answer:**
- First, model capabilities have different requirements. Since we want the generated results to serve Social scenarios, balancing the authenticity of generated content to look like the user's original appearance while satisfying user fantasies is extremely difficult
- Additionally, while prompt-based creation feels simple, it's counter-intuitive. How to provide positive feedback to users during this process is also challenging

## Question 4: What different methods have you tried to solve these technical challenges? (Alternative solutions/iterative versions)

**Answer:**
- We have tried countless versions in both model and APP development, such as whether users should input prompts directly, or use Agents to make creation more intuitive. During this process, how should Social engagement be reflected in positive feedback, and how to validate user expectations through repeated model data adjustments. We have refined and polished countless times throughout this process

## Question 5: Have you developed any prototypes to test these ideas? What alternative solutions have you evaluated or tried?

**Answer:**
- Yes, Pika.art website is actually the source of many ideas. Pika.art is a native video generation tool where users can derive any other content they're interested in through text, images, and videos on Pika.art

## Question 6: What conclusions have you drawn from these works/prototypes? Is this a failed project?

**Answer:**
- From Pika.art, we concluded that most people's generation needs still revolve around Social content, specifically content related to themselves. This is why we conceived the idea of a Social AI content platform
